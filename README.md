This is a tool that helps with the mobile game Hero Wars. It helps plan attacks on Hydras in Guilds.


It is a single html file that you can open with your web browser (works best on a computer/laptop). All of the data is stored locally so you don’t have to worry about anyone having your data but you. This also means you cant collaborate on the results so it’s for 1 person in the guild to manage.

If anyone wants to improve on it feel free or if you have ideas, let me know. It does not take into account hero lineups so it is only as accurate as the buffer you set for each hydra. It is only to be used as a reference and cannot be thought of as completely accurate.

Features:
 -    You can add/remove players and log their scores for each Hydra Head
 -    You can adjust the total health of each Hydra in case Nexters adjust them in the future
 -    You can adjust the buffers for each Hydra which helps you hone in on its accuracy for your guild
 -    You can include/exclude each player in each hydra calculation in case you want someone for a specific hydra
 -    You can include the golden horns for each player if you would like to see how the calculations change
 -    It tells you the suggested targets for each player
 -    It tells you who is left over for cleanup and how many attacks they would have
 -    It tells you the predicted damage to each head
 -    You can set the Hydra heads current damage so you are not assigning targets to something dead already
 -    You can set the number output format to shorthand or full
